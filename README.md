# SkillSage – AI-Powered Career Coach 🚀

SkillSage is an AI-powered career development platform designed to assist job seekers with tailored resume analysis, skill-gap detection, and smart recommendations. The system leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide insightful, context-aware feedback on career documents like resumes and job descriptions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is still under development. The backend is functional, and the frontend UI is in progress. The platform will be publicly live once the frontend is complete and two final features are integrated.
